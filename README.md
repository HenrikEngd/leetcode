# leetcode
 
This project consists of all leetcode problems I have ever solved.

When solving leetcode problems I have the following rules:

- No use of LLMs / copilot or any sorts of autocomplete or suggestions.
- Googling is ok (besides googling for the actual solution for the leetcode problem)

Additional info:
As of 23.08.2024 I am trying to solve atleast one leetcode problem everyday. The reason for this is that i want to learn a new programming language (python) and find this to be a good way of learning it at the same time
